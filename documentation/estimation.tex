\section{Requirements and Project Estimation}
The estimation of the project was done using COCOMO 2.
Therefore the metric used here is Lines Of Code (LOC).

First project estimation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Behavior Simulation
  	\begin{itemize}
        \item eat (Guess: 450 LOC)
        \item insulin (Guess: 400 LOC)
        \item diabetes (Guess: 400 LOC)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Simulating Insulin Pump
  	\begin{itemize}
        \item actor (Insulin injection) (Guess: 600 LOC)
        \item sensor (Glucose Level Monitor) (Guess: 150 LOC)
        \item User Interface (Alarm/Input) (Guess: 500)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize} 
Guessed Estimation based on Experts Cocomo 2:
Effort 13.4 Person-months
Schedule 8.5 Months
